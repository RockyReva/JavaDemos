## Bootstrap

To include the latest version of Bootstrap in your project, you can add the following code to the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0-alpha1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0-alpha1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

This will include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files from the Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network) in your project. You can then use Bootstrap classes and components in your HTML code to style and enhance your web page.
```
